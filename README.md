# aiSight
Banknote Denomination Recognition

* Machine Learning model using Adam, ReLU, Softmax, Cyclical Learning Rates with SOTA and other Transfer Learning techniques for detection, recognition of valid INR and USD.

* Model exported to [PyTorch Script](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1q6Yk4zLA1sk0vcFF1m6Z9v5_2_dXSFIj) and deployed as a [Mobile Application](https://github.com/mayhem-am/envision) using Dart and as a [Web Application](https://github.com/mayhem-am/vision) using Render.

# Objective : 
* Relay INR or USD banknote denomination if valid, ask to retry otherwise

# Goals :

- [x] dataset collection upto a valid amount (>200)
- [x] model accuracy upto 90%
- [x] accuracy stays unchanged for unbalanced classes
- [x] perspective warping
- [] Grad-CAM
- [] improve accuracy with custom nn and larger dataset
- [x] deploy on Android/iOS
- [] low bandwidth performance improvement
